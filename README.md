# Book_Recommendation_System_Real_World_Data
In this project we will use the scraped data of the website "goodreads" to build a personalized book recommender system.

All of the scraped data and more used for this project can be found here: https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home

I have used the following files: 
- goodreads_books.json.gz (information about all the books: author, title, ...) 
- goodreads_interactions.csv (information about the user-book interactions: has the user read a specific book, ratings, ...)
